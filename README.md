# Thesis Project: Real-Time Robot Simulation and Force Application Analysis

This repository contains the MATLAB and Python code developed for my thesis, focusing on real-time robot simulation, force application analysis, and dataset generation for LSTM neural network training. The project uses a set of MATLAB scripts and a Python Jupyter Notebook to simulate robot behavior, calculate external forces, and generate and analyze a comprehensive dataset for neural network training.

## Scripts Description

### `CPF_script2.m`
This script is responsible for calculating the point of force application on the robot. It utilizes a contact particle filter to accurately determine the application points of external forces during the simulation.

### `LWR_initialization.m`
This script sets up the basic parameters and objects necessary for simulating the robot in MATLAB. It initializes the environment and defines essential variables and settings that are used across the simulation.

### `LWR_sim_realBody.m`
The main function of the project, `LWR_sim_realBody.m`, handles the real-time simulation of the robot. It performs the following key tasks:
- Manages real-time simulation of the robot's movements and interactions.
- Uses residual calculations to determine external torques applied to the robot.
- Calculates wrenches based on the robot's current state and external forces.

### `SimulationForNNDataset_link.m`
This script is designed to generate a comprehensive dataset for training an LSTM neural network. It operates the robot throughout its entire workspace to gather as much data as possible, ensuring a diverse and extensive dataset.

### `LinkAndPointEstimationThroughLSTM.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for developing an LSTM neural network with different methods. It focuses on processing the dataset generated by the MATLAB simulations to estimate links and points of interaction on the robot.

## Running the Code

To run this project effectively, follow these steps:
1. Open two separate MATLAB windows.
2. In the first MATLAB window, run
   ```
   CPF_script2
   ```
    This script will continuously calculate the force application points and does not require waiting for the simulation to progress.
4. In the second MATLAB window, run
   ```
   LWR_sim_realBody.m
   ```
   This script handles the real-time simulation of the robot.

These two scripts communicate with each other and operate independently. The `CPF_script2.m` script receives data every 0.1 second from the simulation running in `LWR_sim_realBody.m`, ensuring that the contact particle filter is consistently updated without delays.
